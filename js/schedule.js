In this session we'll do a deep dive into the JavaScript object model and use the ES5 Object methods to do introspection, inheritance, reflection, and many other common OO tasks, contrasting each example with the old hack that it replaces.

Specifically various web worker architectures will be discussed as well as implementing a 2-Tier Thread Management  system that allows for generating child process outside of the main thread thereby increasing performance of handling/merging data.  New additions to the Web Worker API, Transferrable Objects, will also be discussed and demonstrated to show how utilizing this can affect overall performance.  Multiple examples of multithreading techniques and performance will be shown as well as final demo of a 3D Game (Omega Resistance) using WebGL, WebSockets and WebWorkers with Multithreaded Physics and Artificial Intelligence.",

Since we're currently designing a new user-interface for the next release of this popular CMS, I'd also like your feedback on how much configuration is too much, and where it's essential for the user interface to provide different choices.",

Great idea, but a lot more work on both the server and the client.Enter the modern single page web application (SPA). With the near universal availability of capable browsers and powerful hardware, you can push most of the web application to the browser; including HTML rendering, data, and business logic.

This means users get a fluid, comfortable experience whether they're surfing at their desk or using a phone app on a sketch 3G connection.In this talk you'll learn to build modern browser-based apps that take advantage of stronger client platforms and more-predictable bandwidth.

Offering a browser-based Web service, there is a need to render html5 server-side for initial page display and Web crawlers. It is also desirable to modify and add to a page already displayed in the browser using page fragments. With dual side rendering, the very same code can accomplish these two tasks executing as JavaScript either server side or in the browser.2. Since the 90's templating has been a popular way for html rendering. Templates extend html5 with non-markup directives. In many cases a separation between declarative html5 and imperative JavaScript is to prefer over templates. One alternative is to add data and styling to plain html5 providing such clean separation.Webfiller and tagfinder are two open-source node.js npm modules providing an implementation for dual-side rendering of plain html5. Webfiller can be easily used with Express 2 and 3, and of course with any code intended to render html5. Rendering of plain html5 is a very clean way of rendering Web pages and fragments.",
